# Quantizing with accuracy control {#quantization_w_accuracy_control}

## Introduction
This step is the most advanced quantization flow that allows to apply 8-bit quantization to the model with control accuracy metric. The flow is based on the [Basic 8-bit quantization](@ref basic_qauntization_flow) flow and has the following differences:
